# 🚀 Phase 2 – Manual Vector Simulation

### 🔢 Robot Commands:
1. Move Right 4 → `[4, 0]`
2. Move Up 2 → `[0, 2]`
3. Move Left 1 → `[-1, 0]`
4. Move Down 3 → `[0, -3]`

### ➕ Step-by-Step Vector Addition:

```
Total Vector = [4, 0] + [0, 2] + [-1, 0] + [0, -3]
             = [4 - 1, 2 - 3]
             = [3, -1]
```

### 📏 Norm (Distance from origin):

```
‖[3, -1]‖ = √(3² + (-1)²) = √(9 + 1) = √10 ≈ 3.16 units
```

### ➡️ Unit Direction Vector:

```
[3 / √10, -1 / √10] ≈ [0.948, -0.316]
```

This tells us the robot's direction and displacement from its original starting point.
