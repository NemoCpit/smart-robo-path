# 🤖 Mini Project: Smart Robo-Path – Vector Navigation Simulation

## 📘 Project Summary

This mini-project simulates a robot navigating a 2D grid using vector operations. You will control the robot using directional commands like "move right", "move up", etc., and calculate:

- Final position
- Total displacement
- Total distance traveled (norm)
- Direction of movement (unit vector)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Vector addition
- Basis vectors (î = [1, 0], ĵ = [0, 1])
- Euclidean norm (L2 norm)
- Unit vector calculation
- Markdown documentation

---

## 🧪 Example 1 – Movement Simulation

### 🔢 Commands:
1. Move right 3 units → `3 × î = [3, 0]`
2. Move up 4 units → `4 × ĵ = [0, 4]`

### ➕ Vector Addition:
```
Total Vector = [3, 0] + [0, 4] = [3, 4]
```

### 📏 Norm (Distance from origin):
```
‖[3, 4]‖ = √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5
```

### ➡️ Unit Direction Vector:
```
Unit Vector = [3/5, 4/5]
```
